# 🧠 Machine Learning Time Analysis Platform

## Description
A smart productivity tracking system that analyzes daily time logs to identify behavioral anomalies and improve strategic focus.  
Ideal for professionals aiming to align daily work with personal or team goals, such as dedicating consistent time to high-priority areas like AI, product development, or learning.

## Key Features
- 📊 **Structured Time Logging**: Processes raw time tracking data into a consistent, analyzable format.
- 🔍 **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unexpected time usage or deviations from pre-set commitments.
- 📬 **Automated Feedback**: Sends notifications when trends indicate risk of misalignment with targets.
- 📈 **Goal Tracking**: Ensures regular time is spent on high-impact activities (e.g., "1h/day on AI projects").

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- API Integration
- Data Visualization (for planned dashboarding)

## Results
- 🧠 Identified 15% of time spent on low-value tasks  
- 🚀 Boosted productivity by 20% via behavioral insights and automated feedback

# 📂 Code Snippets
This project includes two real, production-grade code snippets demonstrating intelligent automation and data analysis for time tracking:

## 1. 📄 load_data() — Intelligent Time Parsing and Cleanup
Robustly loads and cleans raw CSV data, merging date and time columns into unified timestamps, handling encoding issues, and converting duration to a standardized format. It ensures data integrity for further analysis.

Key capabilities:

Mixed format handling

Null and error-tolerant datetime conversion

Flexible integration with various time-tracking tools

## 2. 📄 analyze_changes() — Time-Series Comparison with Anomaly Detection
This function uses Isolation Forest to detect anomalies by comparing a day’s activities to historical patterns. It quantifies shifts in time allocation and flags significant deviations for further inspection.

Key features:

Intelligent grouping and normalization

Scikit-learn-based unsupervised anomaly detection

Clear output of significant behavioral shifts

Both snippets reflect real-world challenges in time-tracking automation, with a strong emphasis on data quality, interpretability, and ML-driven insights.
